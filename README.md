ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Neil. I'm a software engineer, usually working on iOS apps.

I love well-designed apps, and try to spend my time making things that simplify peoples' lives in some way. I'm also really interested in tools that improve the software development process. For example, I'm currently learning how to use Shortcuts and GitHub Actions to automate a lot of the deployment steps for my website.
